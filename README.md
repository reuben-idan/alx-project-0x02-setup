## Project Overview

This repository initiates a foundational project designed to introduce and solidify understanding of **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It guides developers through the process of scaffolding a modern web application, implementing reusable components, managing routing, integrating with external APIs, and establishing a robust project structure. The project progresses from initial setup to building interactive UI elements and fetching dynamic data, emphasizing clean code and best practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will be able to:

-   Scaffold a Next.js application configured with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
-   Implement fundamental routing mechanisms using Next.js's Pages Router.
-   Develop reusable React components, leveraging TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
-   Create interactive user interface elements, such as modals and buttons.
-   Fetch and display data from external RESTful APIs.
-   Structure a Next.js project following industry best practices for scalability and maintainability.
-   Effectively work with component props and state management.
-   Build responsive layouts and navigation systems using Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Stack

This project leverages the following core technologies:

-   **Next.js**: A React framework for production-ready applications, enabling server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
-   **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side execution.
